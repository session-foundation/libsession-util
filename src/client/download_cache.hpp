/// A cache of files we downloaded, on disk, encrypted under one key of our own.
///
/// Re-encrypted rather than kept as the file server gave them to us, because the key that opened a
/// download belongs to something that goes away: an attachment's key lives in the message, a
/// profile picture's in the Contacts config, and a deleted message or a changed picture would leave
/// us holding a file we can no longer read.  A key we own outlives both.
///
/// Encrypted rather than kept as plaintext because the disk is not a trusted place: it ends up in
/// backups, in disk images, and in whoever's hands the machine does.  That is also why the padding
/// is kept -- see `attachment::Encryptor`'s key-taking constructor.
///
/// The two halves are kept differently, because only one of them expires.  A cached picture is just
/// a file: what still references it is already recorded in `accounts.profile_pic_url`, and a second
/// record of it would be a second thing to keep in step.  A cached attachment additionally has a
/// row in `attachment_cache`, because eviction has to answer "what is the total, and what was used
/// longest ago" without stat-ing the whole directory to find out.
///
/// That row is an index over the file rather than a second copy of the truth, and either can be
/// missing the other after a crash: a sweep reconciles both directions.
