-- from 001_swarm_hash_history.sql
--
-- Every message hash a storage node has handed us, in the order that node handed it over, with the
-- moment the node will drop it.
--
-- This is where a retrieve's `last_hash` comes from -- the newest unexpired row for that node and
-- namespace -- rather than a stored cursor, so that deleting a hash from the swarm moves the cursor
-- by itself.  A stored cursor has to be corrected by whoever deletes, and the correction is
-- invisible from the delete: config pushes have destroyed their own cursor on every push since they
-- were written, which costs a full retrieve each time and was never noticed because it is only
-- expensive and never wrong.
--
-- Per node, because the cursor is.  Nodes do not agree on storage order, so a hash learned from one
-- node is not a safe cursor for another: at best it is unrecognised and the node replays its whole
-- retention window, at worst the node holds it *after* something we never received, and advancing
-- there skips that message permanently.
--
-- Expiry rather than a row count is what bounds this.  A hash is a usable cursor for exactly as long
-- as the node still holds the message, so the server's own expiry is the honest limit; a count would
-- keep dead hashes and drop live ones at the same time.
--
-- Every hash from a retrieve goes in, including messages we store nothing for -- typing indicators,
-- payloads that do not parse, anything a namespace carries that this build ignores.  Recording only
-- what we kept would leave the cursor behind those, and we would fetch them again on every poll.
--
-- Deliberately no foreign key to the client's `messages`: this is Core's, and a bare Core has no
-- such table.  It would also be the wrong fact -- a row here says a *node* still holds the message,
-- which has nothing to do with whether we kept our copy of it.
--
-- The nodes are their own table because the alternative repeats a 32-byte key in every row and
-- again in every index entry, to say something there are only a handful of distinct answers to.
--
-- Nothing prunes nodes by swarm membership, deliberately.  A node that has left is dead weight, but
-- deciding that requires trusting a swarm list to be complete, and a momentarily narrow one would
-- delete cursors that are still good -- costing a full retrieve from every node it omitted, which is
-- the exact thing this table exists to avoid.  Expiry clears their rows soon enough anyway.
