# Checks that a database created by any previously published version upgrades cleanly to the
# current schema.
#
# full_schema.sql is the only thing that creates a schema; the migrations beside it are deltas from
# an older full_schema.  There is therefore no way to build a database by replaying migrations from
# nothing, and the only starting points that exist are earlier versions of full_schema.sql — which
# exist solely in git history.  That is what this walks.
#
# Starting points are every tag, plus every commit since the most recent tag (so unreleased work in
# progress is covered too, not just published versions), and every revision after SCHEMA_FLOOR.
# Revisions whose schemas are byte-identical to one already checked are skipped: a version that
# changed no schema tells us nothing new, and without this every tag in a quiet period would re-run
# the same check.
#
# Usage: tests/schema_history_check.sh <path-to-schema-upgrade-check>

# A schema is described by full_schema.sql alone, so a change to one that ships without a migration
# leaves no way to carry an existing database across it: the database has to be recreated.  Every
# revision before such a change therefore describes a database that cannot reach today's schema, and
# checking that it does is checking something we deliberately gave up.
#
# Bump this to the then-current HEAD each time that happens.  It is a single revision rather than a
# list because the property is a cutoff: once one database has to be recreated, so does every older
# one.  Everything after it is still walked, which is what keeps a development branch honest between
# cutoffs -- consecutive commits do have to upgrade cleanly.
