/// Helper functions to construct payloads to communicate with the Session Pro Backend. The data
/// structures here are largely bindings to the endpoints exposed on the Session Pro Backend; the
/// wire format they produce and parse is byte-pinned in pro-wire-protocol.md (the authoritative
/// spec).
///
/// The high level summary of the functionality in this file. Clients can:
///
/// 1. Obtain a Session Pro proof with `pro_proof_request(...)` and submit its
///    `{endpoint, content_type, data}` to the backend, which authorises the specified rotating
///    Ed25519 key. Redemption is implicit -- there is no client-submitted "add payment" step: the
///    store notifies the backend of a purchase out-of-band and any master-signed request binds the
///    account's unbound payments before answering (pro-wire-protocol.md §3). After a purchase the
///    client just requests a proof and, until the store notification has reached the backend, gets
///    a not-yet-entitled answer and retries.
///
///    Parse the server's reply with `parse_pro_proof(...)`. Clients should validate the response
///    and update their `UserProfile` by constructing a `ProConfig` with the `proof` from the
///    response and filling in the relevant rotating private key that the proof was authorised for.
///
/// 2. Attach the `ProProof` constructed from (1) into their messages. Libsession has helper
///    functions to embed the proof into their messages via the helper functions in the Session
///    Protocol header file. This is done by assigning the `ProProof` into the
///    `Content.proMessage.proof` protobuf structure. Additionally the caller will use
///    `pro_features_for_message` to determine the correct flags to assign the `features` to
///    `Content.proMessage.flags` in the protobuf structure.
///
///    Lastly the high-level libsession encoding functions accept the rotating private key to which
///    the protobuf encoded plaintext content will be signed and the payload augmented as necessary
///    to enable pro features for that message.
///
/// 3. Periodically poll the global revocation list which overrides the validity of current
///    circulating proofs. This is done by building the request via `revocations_request(...)` and
///    sending it to the backend.
///
///    Parse the reply with `parse_revocations(...)`, which contains the list that clients should
///    cache. Any incoming messages with a Pro proof that is in the list of revoked proofs will not
///    be entitled to Pro features.
///
/// 4. Query a user's Session Pro entitlement status for their Master Ed25519 key by building a
///    `pro_status_request(...)` query (the hot "am I Pro?" path) and submitting it. Parse the reply
///    with `parse_pro_status(...)`, which yields the account status plus its single latest payment.
///
///    For the full payment history (e.g. a receipts view), page through it with
///    `payment_details_request(...)` / `parse_payment_details(...)` using the opaque keyset cursor.
