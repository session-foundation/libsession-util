/// Notifications of everything the conversation layer changes, so that an application never has to
/// ask.  A caller sets the handlers it cares about and leaves the rest empty; an unset handler is
/// simply not called.
///
/// Every handler is given the new state outright rather than an identifier to go and fetch, which
/// is what makes a display bindable without reading anything back.  It also makes applying one
/// twice harmless, which in turn makes startup race-free — see the Client constructor.
///
/// Handed to Client at construction and fixed thereafter, exactly as core::callbacks is.  There is
/// deliberately no way to register a second set: a process that wants to fan these out to somewhere
/// else — a notification daemon, a log — does that fanning out itself, which it has to anyway once
/// the other end is a separate process.
///
/// **Handlers run on Core's event loop**, not the caller's thread.  A handler must not block and
/// must not throw (an escaping exception is caught and logged, and the change is not redelivered).
/// What a handler receives is its own: it was read for this delivery and nothing else holds it, so
/// a UI moves it into its own queue and wakes its render thread.  The signatures say which is
/// which — what is given is taken by rvalue reference, what is lent by `const&`.  The two progress
/// handlers are the ones that lend, because they report repeatedly against one captured id and a
/// handler that moved from it would empty what the next report needs.
///
/// A handler may declare such a parameter as `T&&`, `const T&` or `T`, whichever suits it: only the
/// last constructs anything, and a handler that just reads pays nothing.  (`T&` is the one form
/// that will not bind.)  The `&&` is not perfect forwarding despite the spelling — `std::function`
/// is not a template on its argument — it is a promise by the caller that the object is spent
/// afterwards.
///
/// The conversation list an application maintains from these is expected to be *complete*: the
/// order is given as a whole list, so a partial one cannot be placed in it.  Showing only part of
/// it is fine, holding only part of it is not.
///
/// The order itself is **ours, not the application's**.  Every handler that carries a list carries
/// it already ordered, so an application never has to sort, and should not: the two lists are not
/// sorted the same way and a comparator copied from one gets the other wrong.
