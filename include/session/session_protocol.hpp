/// A complimentary file to session encrypt (which has the low level encryption function for Session
/// protocol types). This file contains high-level helper functions for decoding payloads on the
/// Session protocol. Prefer functions here before resorting to the lower-level cryptography.
///
/// The general overview is that this file introduces functionality to abstract away protobufs types
/// on the Session Protocol from client implementations by wrapping the data structures where
/// necessary in libsession. In general clients will use the functions in this file as follows:
///
/// - Derive Session Pro feature flags from a message for populating the new Pro fields for messages
///
/// - Wrap and/or encrypt a plaintext content message into an Envelope or Websocket message
///   (depending on the configured namespace and destination) ready to be sent on the wire with
///   `encode_for_destination`.
///
/// - Decrypt an incoming message in its websocket wrapped, and or encrypted envelope form with
///   `decode_envelope`
///
/// TODO: In future the goal is to begin abstracting more protobuf types away from client
/// implementations such that the only dependency clients need to encode and decode Session Protocol
/// messages is libsession itself and that it will provide wrapper/proxy types for and handle
/// converting those into the wire format.

// NOTE: In the CPP file we use C-style enums for bitfields and CPP-style enums for non-bitfield
// enums where we can to benefit from the type-safety of strong enums.
//
// CPP doesn't support named bitfields without casting or operator overloads but C-style
// enums support it very well. The only issue is that using a native C-style enum enforces some type
// restrictions that compilers dislike when attempting to manipulate bit fields. For example:
//
//   enum Feature {x = 1 << 0, y = 1 << 1}
//   Feature f = x | y
//
// Causes the compiler to complain about trying to do bit ops/assign an unsigned integer to an enum
// `Feature`. We use a common C pattern/trick by suffixing an underscore to the the original enum,
// then type define the non-suffixed enum to an unsigned integer:
//
//   enum Feature_ {x = 1 << 0, y = 1 << 1}
//   typedef U64 Feature
//   Feature f = x | y
//
// Does not trigger errors as the underlying type of `f` is actually an unsigned integer. The type
// define is merely a hint to the user to what flags are to be used when manipulating the variable.

/// If the message does not use Session Pro features, the `pro` object will be set to nil. Otherwise

/// smaller or larger than expected, decryption failed, or an invariant failed. Notably this

/// field to verify if the Session Pro was present and/or valid or invalid.
///
/// Inputs:
/// - `keys` -- the keys to decrypt either the envelope or the envelope contents. Groups v2
///   envelopes where the envelope is encrypted must set the group key. Envelopes with an encrypted
///   content must set the the libsodium-style secret key of the receiver, 64 bytes. Can also be

/// - `pro_backend_pubkey` -- the Session Pro backend public key to verify the signature embedded in

/// Outputs:
/// - `envelope` -- Envelope structure that was decrypted/parsed from the `envelope_plaintext`
/// - `content_plaintext` -- Decrypted contents of the envelope structure. This is the protobuf

/// - `sender_ed25519_pubkey` -- The sender's ed25519 public key embedded in the encrypted payload.
