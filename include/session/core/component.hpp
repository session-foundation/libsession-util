    /// a thread-safe pool and does not care which thread reads it, but a component is more than
    /// its tables: it caches account key material, holds the config objects, and lazily builds
    /// both.  None of that is synchronised, and Core's loop touches all of it while polling.  So
    /// anything a component does beyond a self-contained query has to happen on the loop, and
    /// every such method asserts `on_loop()` in a debug build.
    ///
    /// A component method that only reads or writes the database through `conn()` is exempt: the
    /// pool hands the calling thread its own connection, and two threads doing that concurrently
    /// is the arrangement it exists for.  Those methods say so individually.
