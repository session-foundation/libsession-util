///   libsodium secret key
/// - `plaintext` -- the binary message to encrypt.
/// - `compress` -- can be specified as `false` to forcibly disable compression.  Normally
///   omitted, to use compression if and only if it reduces the size.
/// - `padding` -- the padding multiple: padding will be added as needed to attain a multiple of
///   this value for the final result.  0 or 1 disables padding entirely.  Normally omitted to
///   use the default of next-multiple-of-256.
/// - `error` -- Pointer to the character buffer to be populated with the error message if the
///   returned `success` was false, untouched otherwise. If this is set to `NULL`, then on failure,
///   the returned `error_len_incl_null_terminator` is the number of bytes required by the user to

///   `error` is NULL. This function will fill the buffer up to `error_len - 1` characters with the

/// - `error_len_incl_null_terminator` The length of the error message if `success` was false. If
///   the user passes in an non-`NULL` error buffer this is amount of characters written to the
///   error buffer. If the user passes in a `NULL` error buffer, this is the amount of characters
