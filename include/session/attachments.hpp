// follows, given an input size N:
//
// - compute the total raw size M as N plus:
// - 1 for the 'S' prefix (outside the encryption)
// - 17 byte encryption overhead (crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_ABYTES = poly1305 MAC +
//   1-byte tag) for every 32kiB (or piece thereof)
// - 1 byte for the minimum padding size
//
// We then take keep the most-significant bit of M (i.e. reduce to the largest power of 2 <= M),
// right-shift this by 5, and that round up to the next multiple of that padding factor.
//
// For example, for an input of 1MB (N=100000), we have an unpadded total size of 1000000+1+31*17 =
// 1000528 (i.e. accounting for the 'S' identifier, and the 31 mac+tag values).  We then obtain the
// highest power of two <= this (524288 = 2^19), right-shift by 5 to get 16384 (2^14), and then
// round up the total size to the next multiple of that: 1015808.  Thus we require an additional
// 15280 padding bytes, and so in total we get:
//
//   1 -- the leading (unencrypted) S
// + 15279 × 0x00 -- leading padding bytes
// + 1 × 0x01 -- final padding byte
// + 1000000 -- encrypted file stream data (ignoring embedded mac+tags)
// + 31 × 17 -- embedded mac+tags after every 32kiB of file stream data
// = 1015808 final output.
//
// (Note that we always including at least one padding byte, and there are some complications in
// the calculation as padding values get large enough to start inducing additional mac+tags; see
