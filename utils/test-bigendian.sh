# Occasional big-endian sanity audit for libsession-util. NOT wired into CI — run it by hand now and
# then (especially after touching hashing or any wire/config serialization).
#
# Most of libsession runs only on little-endian hosts, so endian-sensitive byte serialization — the
# Pro signed-digest encoding (hash::detail::make_hashable's byte-swap branch), config data, protobuf
# packing — normally never exercises its big-endian path. This script builds and runs the test suite
# inside an emulated big-endian target (s390x) so those paths run for real. In particular it exercises
# the [endian] known-answer test (hash::blake2b_pers integer args must be little-endian) on an actual
# big-endian machine, where make_hashable takes its otherwise-never-compiled swap branch.
#
# session-router (the onion-routing layer) is endian-irrelevant to what we test and drags in the
# heaviest deps, so we build with -DENABLE_NETWORKING_SROUTER=OFF. This branch has no ENABLE_NETWORKING
# toggle (networking is always required), so oxen::quic still builds regardless — we satisfy it with
# libngtcp2 + gnutls from apt (nghttp3 is not needed; libquic uses raw QUIC).
#
# Cost: everything runs under qemu-user emulation, so expect a slow build (oxen-libquic is the bulk of
# it). Fine for an occasional manual audit; it is deliberately not in CI.
#
# Requires: Docker, plus a one-time host install of qemu-user-static + binfmt-support (see below).
# Run from the repo root with submodules checked out.
set -euo pipefail

# One-time host prerequisite (Debian/Ubuntu):
#     sudo apt install qemu-user-static binfmt-support
# That registers the binfmt_misc handlers with the "F" (fix-binary) flag, which is what lets Docker
# transparently run foreign-arch images under emulation from inside a container — no privileged helper
# container needed.
